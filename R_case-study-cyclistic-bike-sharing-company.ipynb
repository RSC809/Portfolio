The company's director of marketing believes that increasing the number of yearly subscriptions is crucial for the long-term success of the company. To achieve this goal, my marketing analyst team, also hypothetical, must understand why casual riders would want to become members, and how annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently from occasional riders. To gain insights that can guide the development of the new marketing strategy, we plan to analyze past bike trip data from Cyclistic. Our aim is to identify patterns and insights that can help us produce compelling data visualizations and expert insights. These visualizations and insights will be used to convince Cyclistic's management to approve the new marketing strategy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Description of Data Source\n\nThe primary data source for this project is historical bicycle trip data from Cyclistic, which can be downloaded via the provided link, https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.

Recommendations Base on the Analysis\n\nBased on the key points, here are the top three recommendations for Cyclistic to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members:\n\nOffer discounted annual memberships to casual riders who use the service frequently on Saturdays and Sundays, as these are the days when they take the most trips, and the average trip duration is the highest.\n\nCreate targeted marketing campaigns that emphasize the convenience and and benefits of having a membership at popular start stations for casual riders such as Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St , Millennium Park, and Michigan Ave & Oak St  \n\nConsider offering a loyalty program that rewards frequent riders to incentivize membership, especially those who use the service in the morning or at night, as these are the times when there are more member or casual riders respectively, and they take longer trips on average.","metadata":{}}]}
